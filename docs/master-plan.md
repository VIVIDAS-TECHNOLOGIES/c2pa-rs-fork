# C2PA-RS Fork Master Plan

## Project Vision
Enable robust C2PA signing and validation for DASH VOD MBR CMAF content, making it possible to track and verify the provenance of streaming media content.

## Long-term Goals
1. **Full DASH VOD MBR CMAF Support**
   - Complete implementation of DASH VOD content signing
   - Support for all MBR variants
   - Robust CMAF file handling

2. **BMFF Compatibility**
   - Resolve all BMFF mismatch errors
   - Ensure proper handling of init segments
   - Support for all CMAF box structures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient handling of large media files
   - Optimized signing process for streaming content
   - Minimal impact on playback performance

4. **Integration & Compatibility**
   - Maintain compatibility with upstream C2PA-RS
   - Support for common DASH players
   - Integration with existing media workflows
